# vue-project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Run instructions

1. At first download project and open terminal.
2. Write in terminal `npm i` to download all dependencies.

### Development mode

1. Write in terminal `npm run start`, it will start local server with database and open browser automatically.

### Production mode

1. Write in terminal `npm run build`, it will build the project in dist folder.
2. To start local server for database, write in terminal `npm run server`.
3. To open the built app, write in terminal `serve .`.

- Here you can get an error. To solve it you have to run Powershell as administrator, and run this command `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`. Then rerun `serve .` in terminal.
