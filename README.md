## run-instructions

At first download project and open terminal.
Write in terminal "npm i" to download all dependencies.

To start the app in development mode, wrhite in terminal "npm run start", it will start local server with database and open browser automatically.

To start the app in production mode, write in terminal "npm run build", it will build the project in dist folder.
Then to start local server for database, write in terminal "npm run server".
Then to open the built app, write in terminal "serve .".
Here you can get an error. To solve it you have to run Powershell as administrator, and run this command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted". Then rerun "serve ." in terminal.
